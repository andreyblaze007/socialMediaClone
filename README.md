# Social Media Clone
 Assignment for Web Apps

I have decided to create my social media clone as a Collaborative Storytelling Platform, which essentially means that users can collaboratively write stories and add a sentence or paragraph at a time. This way it could be an ever-evolving story, reflecting the creativity of the community.

The new app will have a clean white background, like a blank page, where users can be creative. One big part of the app is that users can change how their profile looks to match their style. They can pick from lots of different colors to make their posts stand out. Also, they can try out different fonts and use emojis to add fun to their messages.

At first, users can only say if they like or don't like something, which helps them talk to each other easily. But in the future, I plan adding more options and removing the previous ones. These would let people express themselves in different ways, like saying "nice" or "could be better," to show what they think about things in more detail.

People can also make their profiles special. They can put up pictures that show who they are, and if they want, they can share where they're from or how to get in touch with them. This helps everyone feel closer and more trusting when they talk to each other.

Overall, the app would be a fun place where people can show off who they are, be creative, and make friends. It's all about making connections and having a good time.
